# aframe-soccer
An experiment into creating an interactive, physics-enabled 3D scene of a soccer field using A-Frame. Ammo.js and A-Frame Physics System addon are used to provide basic physics (movement and collision). Two first-person-view single-player modes are available, one which counts scores and one which does not. The scene ends when the ball glitches through the walls and goes below the floor level, which unfortunately is bound to happen eventually.

Potential future additional options/modes: time-tracking/time-limit, obstacles

The scene is not compatible with VR or mobile/tablet controls at this time (it requires keyboard input).
